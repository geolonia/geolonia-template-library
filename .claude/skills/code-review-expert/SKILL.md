# Code Review Expert

## Overview

Perform a structured review of the current git changes with focus on SOLID, architecture, removal candidates, and security risks. Default to review-only output unless the user asks to implement changes.

> **Note**: Lint, typecheck, format は lefthook (pre-commit/pre-push) と guard.sh (Hook 4) で自動実行されるため、本スキルでは省略しています。

## Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Action |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Critical | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, correctness bug | Must block merge |
| **P1** | High | Logic error, significant SOLID violation, performance regression | Should fix before merge |
| **P2** | Medium | Code smell, maintainability concern, minor SOLID violation | Fix in this PR or create follow-up |
| **P3** | Low | Style, naming, minor suggestion | Optional improvement |

## Workflow

### 1) Preflight context

- Use `git status -sb`, `git diff --stat`, and `git diff` to scope changes.
- If needed, use `rg` or `grep` to find related modules, usages, and contracts.
- Identify entry points, ownership boundaries, and critical paths (auth, payments, data writes, network).

**Edge cases:**
- **No changes**: If `git diff` is empty, inform user and ask if they want to review staged changes or a specific commit range.
- **Large diff (>500 lines)**: Summarize by file first, then review in batches by module/feature area.
- **Mixed concerns**: Group findings by logical feature, not just file order.

### 2) SOLID + architecture smells

Look for:
- **SRP**: Overloaded modules with unrelated responsibilities.
- **OCP**: Frequent edits to add behavior instead of extension points.
- **LSP**: Subclasses that break expectations or require type checks.
- **ISP**: Wide interfaces with unused methods.
- **DIP**: High-level logic tied to low-level implementations.

When you propose a refactor, explain *why* it improves cohesion/coupling and outline a minimal, safe split.
If refactor is non-trivial, propose an incremental plan instead of a large rewrite.

#### SOLID Smell Prompts

##### SRP (Single Responsibility)

- File owns unrelated concerns (e.g., HTTP + DB + domain rules in one file)
- Large class/module with low cohesion or multiple reasons to change
- Functions that orchestrate many unrelated steps
- God objects that know too much about the system
- **Ask**: "What is the single reason this module would change?"

##### OCP (Open/Closed)

- Adding a new behavior requires editing many switch/if blocks
- Feature growth requires modifying core logic rather than extending
- No plugin/strategy/hook points for variation
- **Ask**: "Can I add a new variant without touching existing code?"

##### LSP (Liskov Substitution)

- Subclass checks for concrete type or throws for base method
- Overridden methods weaken preconditions or strengthen postconditions
- Subclass ignores or no-ops parent behavior
- **Ask**: "Can I substitute any subclass without the caller knowing?"

##### ISP (Interface Segregation)

- Interfaces with many methods, most unused by implementers
- Callers depend on broad interfaces for narrow needs
- Empty/stub implementations of interface methods
- **Ask**: "Do all implementers use all methods?"

##### DIP (Dependency Inversion)

- High-level logic depends on concrete IO, storage, or network types
- Hard-coded implementations instead of abstractions or injection
- Import chains that couple business logic to infrastructure
- **Ask**: "Can I swap the implementation without changing business logic?"

#### Common Code Smells (Beyond SOLID)

| Smell | Signs |
|-------|-------|
| **Long method** | Function > 30 lines, multiple levels of nesting |
| **Feature envy** | Method uses more data from another class than its own |
| **Data clumps** | Same group of parameters passed together repeatedly |
| **Primitive obsession** | Using strings/numbers instead of domain types |
| **Shotgun surgery** | One change requires edits across many files |
| **Divergent change** | One file changes for many unrelated reasons |
| **Dead code** | Unreachable or never-called code |
| **Speculative generality** | Abstractions for hypothetical future needs |
| **Magic numbers/strings** | Hardcoded values without named constants |

#### Refactor Heuristics

1. **Split by responsibility, not by size** - A small file can still violate SRP
2. **Introduce abstraction only when needed** - Wait for the second use case
3. **Keep refactors incremental** - Isolate behavior before moving
4. **Preserve behavior first** - Add tests before restructuring
5. **Name things by intent** - If naming is hard, the abstraction might be wrong
6. **Prefer composition over inheritance** - Inheritance creates tight coupling
7. **Make illegal states unrepresentable** - Use types to enforce invariants

### 3) Removal candidates + iteration plan

Identify code that is unused, redundant, or feature-flagged off.
Distinguish **safe delete now** vs **defer with plan**.
Provide a follow-up plan with concrete steps and checkpoints (tests/metrics).

#### Removal and Iteration Plan Template

##### Priority Levels

- [ ] **P0**: Immediate removal needed (security risk, significant cost, blocking other work)
- [ ] **P1**: Remove in current sprint
- [ ] **P2**: Backlog / next iteration

##### Safe to Remove Now

###### Item: [Name/Description]

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Location** | `path/to/file.ts:line` |
| **Rationale** | Why this should be removed |
| **Evidence** | Unused (no references), dead feature flag, deprecated API |
| **Impact** | None / Low - no active consumers |
| **Deletion steps** | 1. Remove code 2. Remove tests 3. Remove config |
| **Verification** | Run tests, check no runtime errors, monitor logs |

##### Defer Removal (Plan Required)

###### Item: [Name/Description]

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Location** | `path/to/file.ts:line` |
| **Why defer** | Active consumers, needs migration, stakeholder sign-off |
| **Preconditions** | Feature flag off for 2 weeks, telemetry shows 0 usage |
| **Breaking changes** | List any API/contract changes |
| **Migration plan** | Steps for consumers to migrate |
| **Timeline** | Target date or sprint |
| **Owner** | Person/team responsible |
| **Validation** | Metrics to confirm safe removal (error rates, usage counts) |
| **Rollback plan** | How to restore if issues found |

##### Checklist Before Removal

- [ ] Searched codebase for all references (`rg`, `grep`)
- [ ] Checked for dynamic/reflection-based usage
- [ ] Verified no external consumers (APIs, SDKs, docs)
- [ ] Feature flag telemetry reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] Tests updated/removed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team notified (if shared code)

### 4) Security and reliability scan

Check for:
- XSS, injection (SQL/NoSQL/command), SSRF, path traversal
- AuthZ/AuthN gaps, missing tenancy checks
- Secret leakage or API keys in logs/env/files
- Rate limits, unbounded loops, CPU/memory hotspots
- Unsafe deserialization, weak crypto, insecure defaults
- **Race conditions**: concurrent access, check-then-act, TOCTOU, missing locks

Call out both **exploitability** and **impact**.

#### Security and Reliability Checklist

##### Input/Output Safety

- **XSS**: Unsafe HTML injection, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, unescaped templates, innerHTML assignments
- **Injection**: SQL/NoSQL/command/GraphQL injection via string concatenation or template literals
- **SSRF**: User-controlled URLs reaching internal services without allowlist validation
- **Path traversal**: User input in file paths without sanitization (`../` attacks)
- **Prototype pollution**: Unsafe object merging in JavaScript (`Object.assign`, spread with user input)

##### AuthN/AuthZ

- Missing tenant or ownership checks for read/write operations
- New endpoints without auth guards or RBAC enforcement
- Trusting client-provided roles/flags/IDs
- Broken access control (IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- Session fixation or weak session management

##### JWT & Token Security

- Algorithm confusion attacks (accepting `none` or `HS256` when expecting `RS256`)
- Weak or hardcoded secrets
- Missing expiration (`exp`) or not validating it
- Sensitive data in JWT payload (tokens are base64, not encrypted)
- Not validating `iss` (issuer) or `aud` (audience)

##### Secrets and PII

- API keys, tokens, or credentials in code/config/logs
- Secrets in git history or environment variables exposed to client
- Excessive logging of PII or sensitive payloads
- Missing data masking in error messages

##### Supply Chain & Dependencies

- Unpinned dependencies allowing malicious updates
- Dependency confusion (private package name collision)
- Importing from untrusted sources or CDNs without integrity checks
- Outdated dependencies with known CVEs

##### CORS & Headers

- Overly permissive CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with credentials)
- Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Exposed internal headers or stack traces

##### Runtime Risks

- Unbounded loops, recursive calls, or large in-memory buffers
- Missing timeouts, retries, or rate limiting on external calls
- Blocking operations on request path (sync I/O in async context)
- Resource exhaustion (file handles, connections, memory)
- ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)

##### Cryptography

- Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1 for security purposes)
- Hardcoded IVs or salts
- Using encryption without authentication (ECB mode, no HMAC)
- Insufficient key length

##### Race Conditions

Race conditions are subtle bugs that cause intermittent failures and security vulnerabilities. Pay special attention to:

**Shared State Access**
- Multiple threads/goroutines/async tasks accessing shared variables without synchronization
- Global state or singletons modified concurrently
- Lazy initialization without proper locking (double-checked locking issues)
- Non-thread-safe collections used in concurrent context

**Check-Then-Act (TOCTOU)**
- `if (exists) then use` patterns without atomic operations
- `if (authorized) then perform` where authorization can change
- File existence check followed by file operation
- Balance check followed by deduction (financial operations)
- Inventory check followed by order placement

**Database Concurrency**
- Missing optimistic locking (`version` column, `updated_at` checks)
- Missing pessimistic locking (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`)
- Read-modify-write without transaction isolation
- Counter increments without atomic operations (`UPDATE SET count = count + 1`)
- Unique constraint violations in concurrent inserts

**Distributed Systems**
- Missing distributed locks for shared resources
- Leader election race conditions
- Cache invalidation races (stale reads after writes)
- Event ordering dependencies without proper sequencing
- Split-brain scenarios in cluster operations

**Common Patterns to Flag**
```
# Dangerous patterns:
if not exists(key):       # TOCTOU
    create(key)

value = get(key)          # Read-modify-write
value += 1
set(key, value)

if user.balance >= amount:  # Check-then-act
    user.balance -= amount
```

**Questions to Ask**
- "What happens if two requests hit this code simultaneously?"
- "Is this operation atomic or can it be interrupted?"
- "What shared state does this code access?"
- "How does this behave under high concurrency?"

##### Data Integrity

- Missing transactions, partial writes, or inconsistent state updates
- Weak validation before persistence (type coercion issues)
- Missing idempotency for retryable operations
- Lost updates due to concurrent modifications

### 5) Code quality scan

Check for:
- **Error handling**: swallowed exceptions, overly broad catch, missing error handling, async errors
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, CPU-intensive ops in hot paths, missing cache, unbounded memory
- **Boundary conditions**: null/undefined handling, empty collections, numeric boundaries, off-by-one

Flag issues that may cause silent failures or production incidents.

#### Code Quality Checklist

##### Error Handling

**Anti-patterns to Flag**

- **Swallowed exceptions**: Empty catch blocks or catch with only logging
  ```javascript
  try { ... } catch (e) { }  // Silent failure
  try { ... } catch (e) { console.log(e) }  // Log and forget
  ```
- **Overly broad catch**: Catching `Exception`/`Error` base class instead of specific types
- **Error information leakage**: Stack traces or internal details exposed to users
- **Missing error handling**: No try-catch around fallible operations (I/O, network, parsing)
- **Async error handling**: Unhandled promise rejections, missing `.catch()`, no error boundary

**Best Practices to Check**

- [ ] Errors are caught at appropriate boundaries
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly (no internal details exposed)
- [ ] Errors are logged with sufficient context for debugging
- [ ] Async errors are properly propagated or handled
- [ ] Fallback behavior is defined for recoverable errors
- [ ] Critical errors trigger alerts/monitoring

**Questions to Ask**
- "What happens when this operation fails?"
- "Will the caller know something went wrong?"
- "Is there enough context to debug this error?"

##### Performance & Caching

**CPU-Intensive Operations**

- **Expensive operations in hot paths**: Regex compilation, JSON parsing, crypto in loops
- **Blocking main thread**: Sync I/O, heavy computation without worker/async
- **Unnecessary recomputation**: Same calculation done multiple times
- **Missing memoization**: Pure functions called repeatedly with same inputs

**Database & I/O**

- **N+1 queries**: Loop that makes a query per item instead of batch
  ```javascript
  // Bad: N+1
  for (const id of ids) {
    const user = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?`, id)
  }
  // Good: Batch
  const users = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?)`, ids)
  ```
- **Missing indexes**: Queries on unindexed columns
- **Over-fetching**: SELECT * when only few columns needed
- **No pagination**: Loading entire dataset into memory

**Caching Issues**

- **Missing cache for expensive operations**: Repeated API calls, DB queries, computations
- **Cache without TTL**: Stale data served indefinitely
- **Cache without invalidation strategy**: Data updated but cache not cleared
- **Cache key collisions**: Insufficient key uniqueness
- **Caching user-specific data globally**: Security/privacy issue

**Memory**

- **Unbounded collections**: Arrays/maps that grow without limit
- **Large object retention**: Holding references preventing GC
- **String concatenation in loops**: Use StringBuilder/join instead
- **Loading large files entirely**: Use streaming instead

**Questions to Ask**
- "What's the time complexity of this operation?"
- "How does this behave with 10x/100x data?"
- "Is this result cacheable? Should it be?"
- "Can this be batched instead of one-by-one?"

##### Boundary Conditions

**Null/Undefined Handling**

- **Missing null checks**: Accessing properties on potentially null objects
- **Truthy/falsy confusion**: `if (value)` when `0` or `""` are valid
- **Optional chaining overuse**: `a?.b?.c?.d` hiding structural issues
- **Null vs undefined inconsistency**: Mixed usage without clear convention

**Empty Collections**

- **Empty array not handled**: Code assumes array has items
- **Empty object edge case**: `for...in` or `Object.keys` on empty object
- **First/last element access**: `arr[0]` or `arr[arr.length-1]` without length check

**Numeric Boundaries**

- **Division by zero**: Missing check before division
- **Integer overflow**: Large numbers exceeding safe integer range
- **Floating point comparison**: Using `===` instead of epsilon comparison
- **Negative values**: Index or count that shouldn't be negative
- **Off-by-one errors**: Loop bounds, array slicing, pagination

**String Boundaries**

- **Empty string**: Not handled as edge case
- **Whitespace-only string**: Passes truthy check but is effectively empty
- **Very long strings**: No length limits causing memory/display issues
- **Unicode edge cases**: Emoji, RTL text, combining characters

**Common Patterns to Flag**

```javascript
// Dangerous: no null check
const name = user.profile.name

// Dangerous: array access without check
const first = items[0]

// Dangerous: division without check
const avg = total / count

// Dangerous: truthy check excludes valid values
if (value) { ... }  // fails for 0, "", false
```

**Questions to Ask**
- "What if this is null/undefined?"
- "What if this collection is empty?"
- "What's the valid range for this number?"
- "What happens at the boundaries (0, -1, MAX_INT)?"

### 6) Output format

**Check `--auto` flag FIRST to decide output format.**

#### Auto mode output (--auto flag present):

Use this **compact format only**. Do NOT use the full format below. Every token saved here is a token available for commit/push/PR steps that MUST follow.

```
Review: X files, Y lines
P0: 0 | P1: 0 | P2: N | P3: N
[If P0/P1 exist, list ONLY those — one line each: file:line — description]
```

That's it. No P2/P3 details, no removal plan, no suggestions, no markdown headers. **Maximum 10 lines.**

#### Interactive mode output (no --auto flag):

Structure your review as follows:

```markdown
## Code Review Summary

**Files reviewed**: X files, Y lines changed
**Overall assessment**: [APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT]

---

## Findings

### P0 - Critical
(none or list)

### P1 - High
- **[file:line]** Brief title
  - Description of issue
  - Suggested fix

### P2 - Medium
...

### P3 - Low
...

---

## Removal/Iteration Plan
(if applicable)

## Additional Suggestions
(optional improvements, not blocking)
```

**Inline comments**: Use this format for file-specific findings:
```
::code-comment{file="path/to/file.ts" line="42" severity="P1"}
Description of the issue and suggested fix.
::
```

**Clean review**: If no issues found, explicitly state:
- What was checked
- Any areas not covered (e.g., "Did not verify database migrations")
- Residual risks or recommended follow-up tests

### 7) Next steps — AUTO vs INTERACTIVE

**STEP 1: Check if `--auto` flag is present.**

#### If `--auto` IS present (auto mode):

1. If P0 or P1 issues exist -> fix them immediately, no questions asked
2. If NO P0/P1 issues -> output the summary
3. **MANDATORY: Write review marker file** (both with and without P0/P1 fixes):
   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD > .code-review-done
   ```
   This enables the `guard.sh` Hook 6 pre-push check. Run this command immediately after confirming P0/P1 = 0.
4. **MANDATORY RULES for auto mode:**
   - Do NOT use AskUserQuestion under any circumstances
   - Do NOT display the "Next Steps" / "How would you like to proceed?" template below
   - Do NOT ask for confirmation, approval, or "go ahead"
   - Do NOT wait for user input
   - After outputting the summary (and fixing P0/P1 if any), the **review phase** is complete. Immediately continue with whatever remaining steps your current workflow requires (e.g., git add, commit, push, PR creation, report). Do NOT stop here.

#### If `--auto` is NOT present (interactive mode):

After presenting findings, ask user how to proceed:

```markdown
---

## Next Steps

I found X issues (P0: _, P1: _, P2: _, P3: _).

**How would you like to proceed?**

1. **Fix all** - I'll implement all suggested fixes
2. **Fix P0/P1 only** - Address critical and high priority issues
3. **Fix specific items** - Tell me which issues to fix
4. **No changes** - Review complete, no implementation needed

Please choose an option or provide specific instructions.
```

**Important** (interactive mode only): Do NOT implement any changes until user explicitly confirms. This is a review-first workflow.

When the user confirms "no changes" or all fixes are complete (P0/P1 = 0), write the marker file:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD > .code-review-done
```
